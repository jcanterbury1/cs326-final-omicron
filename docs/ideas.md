Innovation Idea:
Our project idea is a page for off campus students in Amherst to submit reviews
on landlords, apartments, grocery stores, laundromats etc and then search
reviews. A similar application would be Yelp where reviewers write reviews on
different businesses and people can search those reviews. This targets tourists
and people who are new to an area. Another similar application would be Rate My
Professor where reviewers write reviews on professors around the country and
students can read those reviews on those professors. This targets university
students. Our idea combines these two audiences and targets university students
who are new to an area.

Important Components:
We will allow users to read and write reviews on different categories which
will cover the user interactivity requirement. These categories will include
landlords, apartments, grocery stores, laundromats etc which will cover the
data types requirement. Users will be allowed to create accounts and log in and
out to read and write these reviews which will cover the user authentication
and authorization requirement.
