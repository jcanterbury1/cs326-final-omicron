Innovation Idea:
Our project idea is a page for off campus students in Amherst to submit reviews
on landlords, apartments, grocery stores, laundromats etc and then search
reviews. A similar application would be Yelp where reviewers write reviews on
different businesses and people can search those reviews. This targets tourists
and people who are new to an area. Another similar application would be Rate My
Professor where reviewers write reviews on professors around the country and
students can read those reviews on those professors. This targets university
students. Our idea combines these two audiences and targets university students
who are new to an area.

Important Components:
We will allow users to read and write reviews as well as ask questions on
different categories which will cover the user interactivity requirement. Each
category will have a list of places sorted by the number of likes and each
place will have reviews and questions which will cover the data types
requirement. Users will be allowed to create accounts and log in and out to
read and write these reviews which will cover the user authentication and
authorization requirement.
